# Examples of concurrency in Python

These examples are slight modifications of code presented in _Speed Up Your Python Program With Concurrency_:

- Publication: [https://realpython.com/python-concurrency](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency)

- Code: [https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/concurrency-overview](https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/concurrency-overview)

## Up and running with examples

Run examples with `run.sh`:

```bash
$ chmod 744 run.sh
$ ./run.sh
```

You can specify `--io` or `--cpu` flags:

```
$ ./run.sh --io
$ ./run.sh --cpu
```

Note: any first running will setup virtual environment.
